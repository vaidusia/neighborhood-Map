# Project

I developed a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood so users could see what things they could do there.

# Extra libraries

- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- KnockoutJS

# how to start

You should download all files to your computer and open index.html file using 
Google Chrome or other browser.

# what was done

- used Knockout to show list of objects, search bar 
- used Wikipedia API to show information about objects
- error message
